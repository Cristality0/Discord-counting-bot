# Discord-counting-bot
A python code that will automatically count for you in discord server as a server
I DO NOT PROMOTE ANY USE OF THIS CODE TO BREAK ANY RULES

Created this because the discord server I was in had a counting channel and I need some mee6 XP.

Note that the bot only works with simple GUI set up in discord settings as it coppies the last message and not downloads from the API
For getting coordinated you can use the code provided or other tools like ShareX
